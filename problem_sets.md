## Weekly Problem Sets

Here are the problem sets for each week of PILOT learning.
- The problem sets will be updated before Monday each week, it is consisted of a compact and a printable version, accompanied by a passcode protected solution manual.
    - We might update problem sets and solution manuals due to minor typos, so please always refresh for the latest version.
    - The compact version will have all questions piled together, just like traditional PILOT sets. The printable version will have each question starting on a new page, which is more optimal if you were to print it out or doing it over a tablet.
    - The solution is passcode protected to encourage attendance to PILOT sessions, ask your PILOT leader while you are attending that session.
- Additional resources would be tagged or linked in the resources' column.
    - Also check out the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources.html#important-documents) for additional notes and practices.
