## Archive Documents

- [PILOT Archives](https://jhu-ode-pilot.github.io):
    - Archived documents for Past PILOT term, feel free to check out the documents for practices purposes.
- [Previous ODEs (MATH302) Class Page from Prof. Brown](https://math.jhu.edu/~brown/courses/f18/Syllabus302.html):
    - This page is an archive page that Professor Brown used for his ODE class in F18. Some notes and assignments might be helpful in providing materials for previewing or reviewing the materials.
- [Previous ODEs (MATH302) Class Page from Prof. Lindbald](https://math.jhu.edu/~lindblad/302/302.html):
    - This page is an archive page that Professor Lindbald used for his ODE class in F14. Some notes and assignments might be helpful in providing materials for previewing or reviewing the materials.
- [Previous Hons. ODEs (MATH306) Class Page from Prof. Bernstein](https://math.jhu.edu/~bernstein/math306/index.html):
    - This page is an archive page that Professor Bernstein used for his Honors ODE class in F14. Some notes and assignments might be helpful in providing materials for previewing or reviewing the materials.
- [Pual's Online Notes for ODEs](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx):
    - A popular site contributed by a professor includes notes and exercises from various classes. Note that more than ODEs can be found on this site, and the syllabus could vary among these classes.

## Important Documents

- [Conceptual Problem Set]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/Conceptual-Problem-Set.pdf):
    - A specially designed extra problem set is updated for students who are interested in mathematical proof and fun questions underlying ODEs. The extra problem set contains approximately 2 problems for each week. This set is completely voluntary, and its contents are mostly outside the scope of this class (conventionally).
    - If you would want to discuss any of the problems, please contact the HPL.
- [Theorem Booklet]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/Theorem-Booklet.pdf):
    - This document includes various definitions, theorems, and formulas about ODE that was initially compiled during Fall 2022 and adjusted up until Fall 2024. The document <i>is updated</i> to accommodate this semester.
- [Laplace Table](({{site.baseurl}}/resources/Laplace_Table.pdf)):
    - This document includes a table of Laplace transformation that most instructors would provide during their assessments. This document can be a helpful tool before your instructor has provided you with their version. <i>This is not necessary this semester.</i></li>
- [Activity Slide]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/Activities-Slides.pdf):
    - Here is a set of slides deck that we could be playing with when we need some engagements. Feel free to play with some of it in advance.
